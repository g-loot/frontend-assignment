# G:LOOT front-end assignment
## Instructions
Build a front-end application that communicates with the server provided in this repository. You may use any library/framework/technique/boilerplate that you like and deem suitable for this assignment.

The application you will build is a very simple player management tool. The user should be presented with a list of players received from the server, and have the option to add new players and update/delete existing ones.

## How to run the server
The server is a minimal HTTP-server exposing a REST-type API written using nodeJS and Express. You may alter the server code in any way you wish.

 1. Clone this repository.
 2. Open a terminal and run `npm i && npm run start` from the project root.
 3. The server is now running on `localhost:3000`. You can test the server by going to `http://localhost:3000/players` in your browser.

The API is described in `index.js` within the project root.

## Evaluation
These are some of the things we appreciate:

 - Easy, clean, well-indented and readable code, no unnecessary complexity.
 - Usage of a component-based library/framework (react, angular, vue or similar).
 - Testable code (separation of concern, referential transparency).
 - Handling of asynchronous fetching of data from an API.
 - Do not reinvent the wheel.
 - Display some CSS/styling skills.
 
## Submission notes:
 -  If you are using a boilerplate, please submit the boilerplate code and your own code in different git commits, so that we may differentiate the two.
 - Uploading the assignment to github and sending us the link is our preferred method of submission. However you may send the project as a zip file instead if github is not an option for you.
